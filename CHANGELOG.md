# Changelog

## 0.0.5 — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Add Spout MediaIO nDisplay output path.
- Implemented a dedicated `SpoutMediaIO` module with custom media output/capture classes and a direct nDisplay render-hook fallback so viewport frames are sent reliably when `MediaCapture` callbacks are not dispatched.

## 0.0.4 — 2026-04-30

### Added
- GPU-direct receiver path via D3D11-on-12 wrapping. Replaces the staging-texture readback with a single `CopyResource` straight into the UE RHI destination — no `Map`/`Unmap`, no per-frame CPU memcpy.
- CVar `r.Spout.GPUReceiver` (default `1`). `1` = GPU-direct, `0` = legacy CPU readback.

### Changed
- Sender/receiver registry keyed by `(FName, ESpoutType)`. A sender and a receiver sharing a name no longer corrupt each other; `FSpoutSender::Close` is scoped to senders only.
- Optional render-target destination on the receiver now matches the primary destination bit-for-bit (was producing wrong-colored output on format mismatch).
- Legacy receiver path no longer allocates a per-frame `TArray<uint8>` — mapped pointer goes straight to `RHIUpdateTexture2D`.
- Spout ThirdParty headers moved to `PrivateIncludePaths` so they no longer leak into consumer modules.
- MID outer now `GetTransientPackage()` instead of `nullptr`.
- Deprecated `GetTexture2DRHI()` replaced with `GetTextureRHI()`.
- Sender RHI `FromState` now driven by `bIsViewport` (`Present` for viewport backbuffers, `SRVMask` for render targets).
- `InitMutex` on `FSpoutD3DContext` marked `mutable` so `IsInitialized() const` can take the lock.

### Fixed
- Compile error from mistyped field name (`bUseRenderTarget` → `bIsViewport`).
- Strict-aliasing UB in the `IUnknown**` argument to `D3D11On12CreateDevice`.
- Theoretical `uint32` overflow in `RowPitch * Height` for very large textures.
- Packaging build failure on Game targets — added missing `#include "UObject/Package.h"` for `GetTransientPackage()`.

No public BP / exported-symbol changes.

## 0.0.2
- Minor bug fixes.
- Added support for HDR capture when using SceneCapture2D. The preferred setup for best final quality is now Final Color (HDR in Linear Working Color Space) as the Capture Source, paired with an RGB8 sRGB Render Target.

## 0.0.1
- First release
